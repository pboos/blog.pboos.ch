As some of you might now I did an internship in Japan between July 1st and
September 30st. I did it at a company called [D&M
Pearl](http://www.dandmpearl.co.jp) which is located close to Shinjuku. It was
a great time there. But what did I do in those three months you wonder?
Specially because it is a pearl company you might wonder, what I could do
there as a programmer. Well let me help you. I created a webshop for them. The
shop is called [pearls4girls](http://pearls4girls.jp). My internship ended at
the end of September and I joined a new company called
[tonchidot](http://tonchidot.com/) in Shinjuku where I do Android programming.

Since I started working at the new company we finished the webshop and are
ready to launch it! Feel free to check out the webshop located at
[http://pearls4girls.jp](http://pearls4girls.jp). And if you find something
nice for your wife or girlfriend, don't hesitate to buy it :).

Well some more technical info what I did for the webshop. I created the
webshop using the community edition ofÂ [Magento](http://magentocommerce.com).
It offers a great variety of features. I removed some of the features we
didn't need and added some features we did need like delivery date and time.
There are a lot of modules for Magento. Some I could use, but for delivery
date and time I had to do some more programming. Creating modules for Magento
is kind of difficult. But after you learn how it works, it is actually pretty
nice. But I still don't know everything in Magento. What I really liked in
Magento is the way you can design the website. It works with layouts and
templates. Layouts are XML files that define what is shown on which page.
Which boxes appear where and when. It is really flexible. And in the templates
.phtml files you create the actual html design which can include php. And you
can easily switch between different design. And that even in the same store!
It is pretty nice. Even though we only created one design for our webshop.
