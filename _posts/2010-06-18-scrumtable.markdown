Yesterday we finished our bachelor project called ScrumTable which we did at
the [HSR](http://www.hsr.ch). It was a fun time together with Michael Gfeller
and Silvan Gehrig. We received wonderful feedback about ScrumTable. Michael
and Silvan will continue to develop ScrumTable at the HSR.

ScrumTable can be used in Scrum Meetings in cooperation with a Microsoft Team
Foundation Server. You can move and edit your Work Items from the Team
Foundation Server during the scrum meetings and it will be saved back to the
Team Foundation Server immediately. Used technologies:

  * C# & WPF
  * Microsoft Surface SDK 1.0
  * Microsoft Team Foundation Server 2010
  * Scrum

**[UPDATE]**  
Project is continued by the University. Read updates or get in contact through
