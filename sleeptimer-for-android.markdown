Current Version: 1.2

Fall asleep to your favorite music. Will turn of the running music player.
Runs on Froyo. But on Froyo not all players are supported.

Features:

  * Fade out and stop music after a set time
  * Shake extend (1 minute before end a notification sounds and through shaking the phone it extends the SleepTimer)
  * Stop any program that is not supported (choose which one in Settings)
  * Turn off WiFi (optional)
  * Turn off Bluetooth (optional)
  * Turn off Notifications volume (optional)
  * Turn on airplane mode (optional)
  * Button to launch your Music Player (configure in Settings)
  * Automatic sending of a bug report on "force close"
  * Feedback button (and possible to include running services)
  * Unlock through buying "SleepTimer Paid"
Unlocked Features:

  * Widget
  * No ads
Working music players:

  * Standard Android Music Player
  * HTC Music Player
  * Streamfurious Lite (could someone with the pro version tell me if it is working as well?)
  * Google Listen
  * TuneWiki
  * and others...
  * (Please report the ones not working)

IMPORTANT:

  * Before Froyo: App should be able to kill any Music App.
  * Froyo and higher: This app can not kill the app starting with Froyo. But SleepTimer will try to pause the music player with a "Pause Media Broadcast" (selectable in settings). If that does not work, it is not possible to pause the music off that app. Google made that impossible for me with some changes in Froyo.
  * Froyo and higher rooted: If the phone is rooted it tries to still kill the if possible through root, but is not always successful.
