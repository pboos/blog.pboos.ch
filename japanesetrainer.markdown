Program to create Mp3s from [http://www.smart.fm](http://www.smart.fm) lists.
These can then be put on your Mp3 player so you can listen to them. This will
create two folders (EngJap and JapEng) containing  the mp3 files. Those folder
are located in the same folder as the program is in.

Create WordList (PDF) creates a PDF file in which the words are listed. You
can choose what should be shown in them. Example PDF can be found
[here](http://pboos.ch/downloads/WordList.pdf).

Create Cards (PDF) creates a PDF file with cards. 1st Page with the front of
the cards and the 2nd page with the back of the cards. It is made so, that you
can print them out on one paper (front and back) and the cards can then be cut
and the right back card is on the back. Example PDF can be found
[here](http://pboos.ch/downloads/WordCards.pdf).

Now you can save personal lists offline. Add Items from Smart.fm and delete
them from your list when you have studied them.

**NOTE: This program is still under development. But it should already work. But there might be some bugs. Please report them.**
